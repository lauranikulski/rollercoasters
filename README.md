# rollercoasters

Used during meetup - page here https://community.codecademy.com/events/details/codecademy-seoul-presents-python-portfolio-projects-roller-coasters-data-visualisation-project-walkthrough-30-mins/ 

Roller Coasters is an open-ended challenge project available on Codecademy - a couple of data frames plus questions to help you test your skills & knowledge. There are so many different ways of going about completing this one. 
You may consider attending if - 

- you have tried your hand already and would like to compare solutions or ways of going about things (my favourite part about meet-ups!), 
- are planning to do so in the future, or 
- would simply like to have a taste of data visualisation.
